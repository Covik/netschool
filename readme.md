# NetSchool

NetSchool is a Laravel based application I made for my Final project/exam in high school. Core feature is file upload for teachers and students.
Administrator must define courses, subjects, classes and teachers.
After user registration admin adds him to a particular class.

After defining subject it must be connected with course and course year.
Teachers are connected to classes and subjects which are determined by class course and current year.
